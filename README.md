The Disaster recovery sites can provide great benefit in the situations of catastrophic failures or Outages to bring the business back online as soon as possible. There were many challenges in the perspective of standby databases to keep them in sync with highly transaction primary databases. The Author in previous research has mentioned one of the possible and very beneficial solutions to get the standby databases in sync with primary within a short time. Regardless, it was always up to the user to trigger it on their own terms based on their preferences. As a result of the proposed methodology, the standby databases have been provided with the intelligence to take actions automatically based on the current situation. This proposed methodology has recovered the standby database and achieved synchronization in a faster manner than the manual process.

To limit the scope of study and narrow down the research area, this work was concentrated on Oracle databases only. There is still a research gap in other technologies of databases to implement this proposed methodology in them. This future work is open for all scholars to be carried out.
